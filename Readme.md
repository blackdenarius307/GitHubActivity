Python Challenge: Fast as a snake's strike!

Each folder contains all of the required bits to sort through this information! A folder for your data! An executable script!
A folder to accept the output analysis! All thanks to Python.

Each set of data is handled a bit differently. Pybank inputs your information into two separate dictionaries, which the code 
then cross references to grab the relevant information and make the calculations. Pypoll is handled mostly through sheer iteration
in a loop, then printed to the text file, no muss, no fuss.
